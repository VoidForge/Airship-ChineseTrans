RUINSCleared3=Stumbling into a hidden enclave, you find out that your men are surrounded by enemy clockwork spiders backed by soldiers of a neighbouring state. it is unclear if this place was a staging ground for a invasion or a hideout for defectors, it matters not, what does matter is that brutal fighting broke out and after suffering heavy losses and sending in a few waves of troops that you managed to take it over. While you did lose allot of men in the bloodbath you managed to capture a spider production facility with blueprints on how to make these nasty buggers.
RUINSCleared4=YouQUOTEve found a city, most of the city seems to be reduced to rubble and has been that for what seems a few decades. after reaching the center you find various half destroyed foundries all showing different states in producing sizeable and ornate ramming prows. Most notable about the complex is that there seems to have been an arms race to build the biggest and best ram, your engineers reconstruct the process and after building a foundry of our own we are now able to produce grand prows of our own.

As you enter the mine you notice the walls are covered from top to bottom in giant crystals, following the cave leads deeper and deeper, until you enter a giant cavernous section you see something you never have before. the mountain is not just a mountain it appears to be a dormant volcano and in front of you rivers of lava flow past, some of those a different colour, that of suspendium, another thing that catches your eye is the fact that suspendium constructs peacefully float around. Around these streams there is capture and extraction equipment. You decide to explore some more and find a large extensive building carved into the walls, searing it all yields nothing until you find a short but sturdy old man sporting a massive beard wielding a hammer almost as big as himself, after some grunting and bargaining with alcoholic beverages the man tells you he is a specialist in all things suspendium, but he refuses to tell why is the only soul around all you hear is him mumble about something too deep... Some drinks later you come to a agreement for him to become a teacher to your suspedium craftsmen and teach them all he knows in exchange for a easy life of luxury and parties.
RUINSCleared9=ITQUOTES A TRAP! too late your crew realise that they have walked straight into a carefully planned scheme set up by your rivalling enemies. after a big mess, whether by ransom or collateral damage your administration and army managed to rack up quite a cost to your treasure in maintaining the operations surrounding this event, you even suspect some of your advisors to be in on this and to be conspiring against you.
RUINSCleared10=you have found a small deactivated clockwork horror, the kind of horror that normally is a city sized organism like machine, thanks to this golden opportunity you have been able to produce small constructs, self-control and auto-reload mechanisms for use in battle and for reducing the amount of "living" crew on your ships, in some cases down to zero.
RUINSCleared0=Nothing, your men spend half a day searching but thereQUOTEs nothing to be found or gained. after cursing the bad luck your men head elsewhere hoping that this was just a fluke.
RUINSCleared11=You accendentally ambush a group of scientific explorers from another empire thinking it was a scout party of spies to scope out your city, it was however just a bunch of civillians scientist. altough you still detain them for further questioning, amoung thier possessions are a pair of ornate gilded tellescoops wich you promptly take and oh yeah there are some journals about the landscape but they donQUOTEt bother you at this point.
random=A pair of docile drones have been found. initially everyone wanted to shoot everything they had at them, but the greying fleet admiral commanded them to wait, and so they did... mostly. As this is such a rare opportunity you have ordered your wise-men to observe these pair. a few days later you hear that have they found out that these drones are a intertwined mix of beast and machine and have been able to make them breed to allow you to use these creatures in modules. it seems that they can be taken apart and that the parts will work if provided some form of power.
